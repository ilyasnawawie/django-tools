models.py:

This file is where you define your Django models, which represent the database structure and data schema.
Models are defined as Python classes that inherit from Django's models.Model class.
You define fields, relationships, and behavior for your data using various field types provided by Django.

views.py:

In the views.py file, you define the views of your Django app.
Views are functions or classes that handle HTTP requests and return HTTP responses.
You can define different views for various URL patterns and encapsulate the logic to process requests, retrieve data from models, and render templates.

urls.py:

The urls.py file contains the URL routing configuration for your app.
URL patterns map specific URLs to the corresponding views that handle those URLs.
You define the URL patterns using Django's URL patterns syntax, specifying the URL patterns and associating them with the corresponding views.

admin.py:

Django's admin site is a built-in feature that provides a web-based interface for managing data in your app.
In the admin.py file, you can register your models to make them accessible and editable through the admin interface.
By registering your models, you enable CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your app's data through the admin site.

apps.py:

The apps.py file contains the app configuration, including metadata and settings for your app.
You can customize certain behaviors of your app by modifying this file, although the default generated content is usually sufficient for most apps.
